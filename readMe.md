## Installation

Nothing to install. Available in web during development via Ngrok.

## Challenges
- Top-tier APIs not available without partnership agreement
- Inadvertently made Express frontend and backend. While this did not affect the functionality of the job search app, it made it difficult to go back and create a separate React frontend.

## Next Iterations
- Include Job-Seeker dashboard
- Improve React integration with either:
     - interactive salary slider
     - cross-application form job posting/application submission
     - interactve chatbot integrated with AI services
- More advanced functionality on Companies page
- Partner with top-tier job sites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and CareerBuilder to gain more API access
- Create mobile app version
