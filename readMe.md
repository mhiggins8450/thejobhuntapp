# The Job Hunt

As a dedicated developer, I bring a practical and innovative approach to technology solutions in the job market. This repository showcases a job board application I've developed using Node.js, integrating smoothly with APIs like Adzuna and USAJobs to provide a user-friendly platform. My focus in backend development is on creating stable and secure systems using MongoDB and Express.js. The security measures I've implemented, including bcrypt and dotenv, are a reflection of my commitment to data protection. My work is designed to offer effective solutions in job search and recruitment, demonstrating my capability as a reliable contributor to technology teams.

## Installation

Nothing to install. Available in web during development via Ngrok.

## Challenges
- Top-tier APIs not available without partnership agreement
- Inadvertently made Express frontend and backend. While this did not affect the functionality of the job search app, it made it difficult to go back and create a separate React frontend.

## Next Iterations
- Include Job-Seeker dashboard
- Improve React integration with either:
     - interactive salary slider
     - cross-application form job posting/application submission
     - interactve chatbot integrated with AI services
- More advanced functionality on Companies page
- Partner with top-tier job sites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, and CareerBuilder to gain more API access
- Create mobile app version
